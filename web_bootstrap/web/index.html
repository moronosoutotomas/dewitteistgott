              <p>de Witte was born in Ghent, Belgium on 21 July 1992. Around 2009, she started to explore Ghent's
                underground nightclub scene, where she was drawn to electronic music. She started DJing in 2010, mainly
                playing electro music; her production work commenced about two years later. Winning a Studio
                Brussel DJ contest in 2011, she subsequently performed at the Tomorrowland festival. She adopted
                the alias Raving George to avoid negative preconceptions against female DJs, releasing her
                debut EP in 2013. Following the release of a string of EPs on Bad Life and Crux Records, her 2015
                single "You're Mine," which featured Oscar and the Wolf, became a hit.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2015, de Witte dropped her alias and started using her real name. This was accompanied by a change
                in her music style from previously electro and electro house more in the direction of techno. She cites
                a set by German Techno DJ Len Faki that she heard at a festival as the origin of this stylistic
                change. Her debut EP under her name, Weltschmerz, was released on the same year on Turbo
                Recordings. This was followed by a string of 2017 EPs, as well as 2018's Heart of Mine and The
                Healer EPs. de Witte has performed at various notable electronic music events, including Junction
                2 Festival, Boiler Room and Printworks.

              <p>With Gorillaz, Albarn departed from the distinct Britpop sound of his band Blur, exploring a variety of
                musical styles including hip hop, electronic and world music. The band's 2001 debut album, Gorillaz,
                which features dub, Latin and punk influences, went triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in
                Europe, with sales driven by the success of the lead single, "Clint Eastwood". Their second studio
                album, Demon Days (2005), went six times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the US, and spawned
                the successful lead single "Feel Good Inc." The band's third album, Plastic Beach (2010),
                featured environmentalist themes, synth-pop elements and an expanded roster of featured artists.
                Their fourth album, The Fall, was recorded on the road during the Escape to Plastic Beach Tour and
                released on 25 December 2010. </p>
              <p>In 2015, after over 10 years providing the voice of Russel, Remi Kabaka Jr. became a permanent music
                producer for the band.[8] Their fifth album, Humanz (2017) was the band's first in seven years and
                featured a wide array of guest artists,[9] while its follow-up, The Now Now (2018), focused musically on
                Albarn. In 2020, Gorillaz started the Song Machine project, a music-based web series with episodes that
                consisted of standalone singles and accompanying music videos featuring different guests, which
                culminated with their seventh studio album, Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez (2020). The band's
                eighth studio album, Cracker Island (2023), met generally positive reviews as a refinement of their
                usual style.

                <p>During the band's early years, In Flames had a varying group of musicians recording with them,
                  including many session musicians. By the release of Colony (1999), the group had established a stable
                  lineup. Their sixth studio album Reroute to Remain (2002) showed the band moving toward a newer style
                  of music that moved further away from melodic death metal and closer to alternative metal.[2] This
                  decision was criticized by fans of the group's heavier metal sound; however, it increased the band's
                  mainstream audience and bolstered their album sales.</p>
                <p>Since the band's inception, In Flames have released fourteen studio albums, three EPs, and two live
                  DVDs, their latest release being their fourteenth studio album Foregone in 2023. In Flames has been
                  nominated for three Grammis Awards. They won two of these nominations; one for Soundtrack to Your
                  Escape (2004) in the "Hard Rock/Metal of the Year" category, and one nomination for their following
                  album Come Clarity (2006) in the same category.</p>
